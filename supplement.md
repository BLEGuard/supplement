This section provides a list of devices used in the BLEGuard experiment setup, along with corresponding website links.  By following the five steps below, a testbed can be built for collecting Bluetooth in the network environment and detecting simulated attacks.  The testbed includes the components used in the basic deployment, as well as the devices being tested, the platform for simulating attacks, the detection methods, and experimental data.

# Experiment Setup

## Deployment Environment

We deployed BLEGuard by placing the three collectors at selected grid locations within the office. **Table 1** shows all components which are used in testbed. The office provides a typical noisy and challenging indoor environment for evaluating the detection performance of BLEGuard. By recording RF signals within the reception range of the collectors, we discovered significant channel interference from 30 other Bluetooth/BLE-equipped devices (sensors, headsets, smartphones, and laptops), dozens of WiFi access points, and a microwave oven. We also observed that sudden movements of people within the office significantly altered the channel conditions in the monitored environment.

## Device Selection

To exhaustively evaluate BLEGuard, we utilized fifteen different BLE devices which are shown in **Table 2**. These BLE devices cover the mainstream BLE applications (e.g., temperature sensor,  smart lock, and sport band) and popular manufacturers (e.g., Nest, August, Eve, and Xiaomi) with a variety of Bluetooth chips (e.g., DA14580 and nRF51822). We randomly chose nine different locations within the office to place these BLE devices.

## Attack Simulation

To carry out different types of attacks, we utilized four attacker platforms, a Lenovo XiaoXin-15IIL 2020 Laptop, a CSR 4.0 BT dongle, an HM-10 developmental board, and a CYW920735 developmental board, shown in **Table 3**. These platforms were selected because they provide ease of access and programmability, and they utilized different transmit power values. Besides, to thoroughly evaluate the performance of BLEGuard, we launched a variety of spoofing attacks from 12 different locations, some at the center and some at edges of the office. Further, to enrich the evaluation of the effectiveness of the CFO inspection, we utilized different copies of the same BLE device as attackers (in addition to the four attacker platforms). For the unbiased evaluation of the RSSI inspection, we utilized the same BLE device as the benign BLE device and the attacker, and collected its advertising packets by placing it at different locations within the office environment.

## Detection Implementation

BLEGuard can be readily implemented using low-cost, off-the-shelf platforms. We implemented the collector using an Ubertooth One radio connected to a Raspberry Pi running Linux (**Table 4.**). The total cost of such a collector is approximately \$100. We note that when a collector is deployed on a custom-designed platform, the unit cost could be less than \$5 for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module.

The Ubertooth first captures packets on advertising channels. To retrieve the physical features, we modified the Ubertooth firmware to provide carrier frequency offset (CFO) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values for each received packet. This customization is feasible because Ubertooth is an open platform for Bluetooth research and development.

Finally, the Raspberry Pi communicates the packets along with their relevant features to the monitor. We implemented the monitor on an Ubuntu 18.04 desktop PC. At the monitor, all processes, including interacting with collectors, parsing the received information from collectors, and runtime inspection mechanisms, were implemented with approximately 3,000 lines of Python code.

## Experimental Data

For each BLE device, benign advertising packets were collected for 48 hours (throughout day and night). For each attacker platform placed at each location, spoofed advertising packets were collected for around 15 minutes. As **Table 5**, we totally collected 902,890 advertising packets which are comprised of 85.2% benign advertising packets and 14.8% spoofed advertising packets. This data was utilized as the ground truth for our evaluation. **Table 6** supports ten sample device basic information, advertising pattern, and low bound of INT.

| :-----------------: | :-----: |
| advertising packets | 902,890 |
|   benign packets    |  85.2%  |
|  malicious packets  | 14.8%.  |
